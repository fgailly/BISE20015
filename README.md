# CME+BPMN 
Conceptual Modelling and Enterprise-Specific Ontology Evolution Framework implementation for business process modelling

This repository contains an eclipse plug-in which can be used to extend the Eclipse BPMN modeler (http://www.eclipse.org/bpmn2-modeler/) with an ontology view. This ontology view contains a set of enterprise concepts that have their origin in a pre-loaded enterpise-specific ontology and which can be used to annotate the model concepts.
